3.6.0 (2009-02-01)
------------------

- Converted from using zope.app.container to zope.container.

3.5.1 (2009-01-29)
------------------

- Add compatibility for newer zope.traversing releases that require us
  to explicitly set up testing. This also works with older releases.

3.5.0 (2009-01-17)
------------------

- Get rid of zope.app.zapi dependency, replacing its uses with
  direct imports.

- Clean up dependencies, move testing and rotterdam dependencies
  to extra requires.

- Fix mailing list address to zope-dev@zope.org instead of retired
  zope3-dev@zope.org. Change `cheeseshop` to `pypi` in the package
  url.

- Replace __used_for__ in adapters.py with zope.component.adapts
  calls to make more sense. 

- Remove obsolete zpkg files, zcml include file for mkzopeinstance-based
  installations, versions.txt that makes no sense now. 

3.4.0 (2007-10-28)
------------------

- Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.
